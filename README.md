# Stoplight Interview Test -- Part 2

Part two is more free-form, and exercises your ability to write React apps. Starting from the `Stoplight` class
you created in Part 1, you will create a React app to visualize your stoplight, refactored to conform to the reactive paradigm.

What we're looking for here is:

-   Understanding of React
-   Clean HTML5/CSS

Instructions:

# Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) to install dependencies

# Run `npm test -- --watch` to run unit tests (located in `src/__tests__`); you can leave this window open as you work. Unlike the other parts of this exercise, the tests aren't written for you (except a trivial example).

# Run `npm start` to run the application. You can see the application running at http://localhost:3000 (by default).

# Look in `src/App.js` to see how the HTML is structured. You are encouraged to refactor this liberally. Styles are located in `src/App.css`. You are provided with styles that render a stoplight, but you are welcome to create your own or refactor the existing ones.

# Write tests and create components to create two functioning stoplights that change colors correctly when their "Change" button is pressed. They should operate independently.
